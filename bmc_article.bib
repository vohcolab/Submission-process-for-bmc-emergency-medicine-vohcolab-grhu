  abstract = {Background A small number of patients representing a significant demand on emergency department (ED) services present regularly for a variety of reasons, including psychiatric or behavioral complaints and lack of access to other services. A care plan program was created as a database of ED high users and patients of concern, as identified by ED staff and approved by program administrators to improve care and mitigate ED strain. Methods A list of medical record numbers was assembled by searching the care plan program database for adult patients initially enrolled between the dates of November 1, 2006, and October 21, 2007. Inclusion criteria were the occurrence of a psychiatric International Classification Diseases, Ninth Revision, code in their medical record and a care plan level implying a serious psychiatric disorder causing harmful behavior. Additional data about these patients were acquired using an indigent care tracking database and electronic medical records. Variables collected from these sources were analyzed for changes before and after program enrollment. Results Of 501 patients in the database in the period studied, 48 patients fulfilled the criteria for the cohort. There was a significant reduction in the number of visits to the ED from the year before program enrollment to the year after enrollment (8.9, before; 5.9, after; P {$<$} .05). There was also an increase in psychiatric hospital visits (2\%, before; 25\%, after; P {$<$} .05). Conclusion An alert program that identifies challenging ED patients with psychiatric conditions and creates a care plan appears to reduce visits and lead to more appropriate use of other resources.},

  abstract = {Objective Frequent users represent a small proportion of emergency department users, but they account for a disproportionately large number of visits. Their use of emergency departments is often considered suboptimal. It would be more efficient to identify and treat those patients earlier in their health problem trajectory. It is therefore essential to describe their characteristics and to predict their emergency department use. In order to do so, adequate statistical tools are needed. The objective of this study was to determine the statistical tools used in identifying variables associated with frequent use or predicting the risk of becoming a frequent user. Methods We performed a scoping review following an established 5-stage methodological framework. We searched PubMed, Scopus and CINAHL databases in February 2019 using search strategies defined with the help of an information specialist. Out of 4534 potential abstracts, we selected 114 articles based on defined criteria and presented in a content analysis. Results We identified four classes of statistical tools. Regression models were found to be the most common practice, followed by hypothesis testing. The logistic regression was found to be the most used statistical tool, followed by {$\chi$}2 test and t-test of associations between variables. Other tools were marginally used. Conclusions This scoping review lists common statistical tools used for analysing frequent users in emergency departments. It highlights the fact that some are well established while others are much less so. More research is needed to apply appropriate techniques to health data or to diversify statistical point of views.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Case management is an effective, short-term means to reduce emergency department (ED) visits in frequent users of the ED. This study sought to determine the effectiveness of case management on frequent ED users, in terms of reducing ED and hospital length of stay (LOS), accrued costs, and utilization of diagnostic tests. Methods: The study consisted of a retrospective chart review of ED and inpatient visits in our hospital's ED case management program, comparing patient visits made in the one year prior to enrollment in the program, to the visits made in the one year after enrollment in the program. We examined the LOS, use of diagnostic testing, and monetary charges incurred by these patients one year prior and one year after enrollment into case management. Results: The study consisted of 158 patients in case management. Comparing the one year prior to enrollment to the one year after enrollment, ED visits decreased by 49\%, inpatient admissions decreased by 39\%, the use of computed tomography imaging decreased 41\%, the use of ultrasound imaging decreased 52\%, and the use of radiographs decreased 38\%. LOS in the ED and for inpatient admissions decreased by 39\%, reducing total LOS for these patients by 178 days. ED and hospital charges incurred by these patients decreased by 5.8 million dollars, a 41\% reduction. All differences were statistically significant.Conclusion: Case management for frequent users of the ED is an effective method to reduce patient visits, the use of diagnostic testing, length of stay, and cost within our institution.},

METHODS: Participants (n = 115,066) were categorized as: 1) low (1 visit/year; 76\%); 2) moderate (2 visits/year; 14\%); and 3) high (3+ visits/year; 10\%) ED users. Independent variables included predisposing, enabling and needs factors based on the Andersen Behavioral Model. Variables significantly associated with frequency of ED use were entered into a multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: Patients with mental illness (MI), especially substance-related disorders (SRD) and schizophrenia spectrum disorders; bipolar, depressive, anxiety or personality disorders; and those with severe chronic physical illness (needs factors) were more likely to use ED for MH reasons, as were male participants 18-64 years old, and those living in metropolitan areas with high social or material deprivation (predisposing factors). Regarding enabling factors, consultations with outpatient psychiatrists and not seeing a general practitioner (GP) in the year prior to ED visit were associated with high ED use. CONCLUSION: The severity of MI/SRD contributed most to frequent ED use, while social and material deprivation in metropolitan areas, and intensity of medical care also influenced ED use for MH reasons.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Objectives: To determine how the demographic, clinical, and utilization characteristics of emergency department (ED) frequent users differ from those of other ED patients. Methods: A cross-sectional and retrospective cohort study was performed using a database of all 348,858 visits to the San Francisco General Hospital ED during a five-year period (July 1, 1993, to June 30, 1998). A ``frequent user'' visited the ED five or more times in a 12-month period. Results: Frequent users constituted 3.9\% of ED patients but accounted for 20.5\% of ED visits. The relative risk (RR) of frequent use was high among patients who were homeless (RR = 4.5), African American (RR = 1.8), and Medi-Cal sponsored (RR = 2.1). Frequent users were more likely to be seen for alcohol withdrawal (RR = 4.4), alcohol dependence (RR = 3.4), and alcohol intoxication (RR = 2.4). Frequent users were also more likely to visit for exacerbations of chronic conditions, including sickle cell anemia (RR = 8.0), renal failure (RR = 3.6), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (RR = 3.3). They were less likely to visit for all forms of trauma (RR = 0.43). Survival analysis showed that only 38\% of frequent users for one year remained frequent users the next year. However, 56\% of frequent users for two consecutive years remained frequent users in the third year. Conclusions: Frequent use of the ED reflects the urban social problems of homelessness, poverty, alcohol abuse, and chronic illness. Frequent use of the ED shows a high rate of decline from one year to the next. This rate of decline slows after the first year and suggests the existence of a smaller group of chronic frequent users.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Overuse of emergency department (ED) services can result in overcrowding and a substantial increase of health care cost. The purpose of this study was to characterize frequent ED users and to identify the factors associated with frequent ED use in a hospital in Taiwan. METHODS: This retrospective study used Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Service Use as a framework. Frequent ED users ({$>$}/= 4 visits/year) and infrequent ED users ({$<$} 4 visits/ year) were selected randomly from patients visiting the adult ED of a medical center in central Taiwan from October 1, 2000 to September 30, 2001. Telephone interviews were completed for 200 frequent users and 600 infrequent users. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with frequent ED use. RESULTS: Frequent ED users comprised 3.5\% of total ED patients, accounting for 14.3\% of the ED visits. Significant factors associated with frequent ED use were: a regular source of care [odds ratio (OR), 2.79; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.63 to 4.79], alcoholism (OR, 19.4; 95\% CI, 3.84 to 98.0), high outpatient clinic use (OR, 2.66; 95\% CI, 1.72 to 4.11), previous hospitalization (OR, 3.06; 95\% CI, 1.94 to 4.82), chronic disease (OR, 3.07; 95\% CI, 1.78 to 5.29), cancer (OR, 4.16; 95\% CI, 1.29 to 13.4), gastrointestinal disease (OR, 6.28; 95\% CI, 1.95 to 20.2), cardiovascular disease (OR, 8.41; 95\% CI, 2.51 to 28.1), pulmonary disease (OR, 4.21; 95\% CI, 1.04 to 17.1), low level of emergency (OR, 5.43; 95\% CI, 3.40 to 8.68), and dissatisfaction with treatment outcome (OR, 2.62; 95\% CI, 1.32 to 5.20). CONCLUSIONS: Frequent ED users were responsible for a disproportionate number of the total ED visits. Andersen's "need factors" were strongly associated with frequent ED use, while the investigated predisposing factors were not significant. Most patients who visited the ED had a low level of emergency. These findings suggest that implementation of an integrated delivery system may decrease ED use.},

  abstract = {Objective~         The objective of this study was to explore how insurance coverage, access to care, and other individual characteristics are related to the large differences in emergency department (ED) use among the general population.         Materials and Methods~         We used the 1997 and 1999 National Survey of America's Families, a nationally representative sample. People were classified into 3 ED use levels based on the number of visits over the 12 months before the survey: non-ED users (zero visits), occasional users (1 or 2 visits), or frequent users (3 or more visits). We used a multinomial logit model to estimate the effect of insurance status and other factors on levels of ED use, and to compute the odds ratios of being occasional and frequent users as opposed to nonusers among various subpopulations.         Results~         People in fair/poor health are 3.64 times more likely than others to be frequent ED users as compared with nonusers. The uninsured and the privately insured adults have the same risk of being frequent users, but publicly insured adults are 2.08 times more likely to be frequent users. Adults who made 3 or more visits to doctors are 5.29 times more likely to be frequent ED users than those who made no such visits.         Conclusion~         The uninsured do not use more ED visits than the insured population as is sometimes argued. Instead, the publicly insured are overrepresented among ED users. Frequent ED users do not appear to use the ED as a substitute for their primary care but, in fact, are a less healthy population who need and use more care overall.},

Overall, 92\% of adult users made 3 or fewer visits, accounting for 72\% of all adult ED visits; the 8\% of users with 4 or more visits were responsible for 28\% of adult ED visits. Most frequent users had health insurance (84\%) and a usual source of care (81\%). Characteristics independently associated with frequent use included poor physical health (odds ratio [OR] 2.54; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 2.08 to 3.10), poor mental health (OR 1.70; 95\% CI 1.42 to 2.02), greater than or equal to 5 outpatient visits annually (OR 3.02; 95\% CI 1.94 to 4.71), and family income below the poverty threshold (OR 2.36; 95\% CI 1.70 to 3.28).

              Tertiary pediatric hospital.
            
            
              Subject and Methods
              All otolaryngology providers and otolaryngology operating room staff at our institution.
            
            
              Results
              Time-driven activity-based costing demonstrated precise per-case and per-minute calculation of personnel costs. We identified several areas of unused personnel capacity in a basic staffing model. Per-case personnel costs decreased by 23.2\% by allowing a surgeon to run 2 operating rooms, despite doubling all other staff. Further cost reductions up to a total of 26.4\% were predicted with additional staffing rearrangements.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Time-driven activity-based costing allows detailed understanding of not only personnel costs but also how personnel time is used. This in turn allows testing of alternative staffing models to decrease unused personnel capacity and increase efficiency.},

Using a contemporary biopsychosocial model of mental illness, the clinical case management model integrates the clinical acumen, personal involvement, and environmental interventions needed to address the overall maintenance of the patient's physical and social environment. Clinical case management involves 13 distinct activities, including engagement of the patient, assessment, planning, linkage with resources, consultation with families, collaboration with psychiatrists, patient psychoeducation, and crisis intervention.}

Frequent ED visits are known to contribute to ED crowding. This study aimed to identify frequent ED users' characteristics and risk factors related to frequent ED visits.         A retrospective observational study was conducted using ED-based data derived from adult patients at a university hospital. The main exposure variable was frequent ED visits, which were defined as {$\geq$}4 visits within 12 months (January 1\textendash December 31, 2018). Characteristics and risk factors for frequent ED users were evaluated using stepwise regression analysis.         Within the study period, there were 36,932 ED visits involving 29,759 patients. Of these, 3031 (8.2\%) visits were from 556 (1.9\%) patients classified as frequent ED users. The independent risk factors for frequent ED visits were older patients ({$\geq$}65 years); the winter season; daytime discharge from ED; patients with medical aid insurance; and patients designated as high acuity at their first visit. Patients with a malignant neoplasm, mental health disorder, alcohol-related liver disease, chronic kidney disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were associated with more frequent ED visits.         Frequent ED users comprised a significant proportion of total ED visits. Frequent ED users were more likely than occasional ED users to be in poorer health, older, or have a chronic disease or a mental health disorder.},

  abstract = {ObjectivesEmergency department (ED) crowding is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Its etiology is multifactorial, and frequent ED use (defined as more or equal to five visits per year) is a major contributor to high patient volumes. Our primary objective is to characterize the frequent user population. Our secondary objective is to examine risk factors for frequent emergency use.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of pediatric emergency department (PED) visits at the Montreal Children's Hospital using the Syst\`eme Informatique Urgence (SIURGE), electronic medical record database. We analysed the relation between patient's characteristics and the number of PED visits over a 1-year period following the index visit.ResultsPatients totalling 52,088 accounted for 94,155 visits. Of those, 2,474 (4.7\%) patients had five and more recurrent visits and accounted for 16.6\% (15,612 visits) of the total PED visits. Lower level of acuity at index visit (odds ratio [OR] 0.85) was associated with a lower number of recurrent visits. Lower socioeconomic status (social deprivation index OR 1.09, material deprivation index OR 1.08) was associated with a higher number of recurrent visits. Asthma (OR 1.57); infectious ear, nose, and sinus disorders (OR 1.33); and other respiratory disorders (OR 1.56) were independently associated with a higher incidence of a recurrent visit within the year following the first visit.ConclusionOur study is the first Canadian study to assess risk factors of frequent pediatric emergency use. The identified risk factors and diagnoses highlight the need for future evidence-based, targeted innovative research evaluating strategies to minimize ED crowding, to improve health outcomes and to improve patient satisfaction.},

  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: Frequent emergency department (ED) users have been the targets of health care reform proposals and hospital crowding interventions, but it is not clear that common assumptions about this group are supported by data. We review the literature pertaining to frequent ED users, their demographics, acuity of illness, and patterns of health care utilization. We seek to inform development of policies directed at frequent ED use and to highlight potential related challenges. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature on frequent ED users was performed. RESULTS: Frequent users comprise 4.5\% to 8\% of all ED patients but account for 21\% to 28\% of all visits. Most frequent ED users are white and insured; public insurance is overrepresented. Age is bimodal, with peaks in the group aged 25 to 44 years and older than 65 years. On average, these patients have higher acuity complaints and are at greater risk for hospitalization than occasional ED users. However, the opposite may be true of the highest-frequency ED users. Frequent users are also heavy users of other parts of the health care system. Only a minority of frequent ED users remain in this group long term. Complaints vary with age, location, and usage patterns. CONCLUSION: Frequent ED users are a heterogeneous group along many dimensions and defy popular assumptions. The subgroups have not yet been sufficiently defined to allow clearly directed policy design, and many frequent users present with true medical needs, which may explain why existing attempts to address the phenomena have had mixed success at best.},

  abstract = {Quasi-experiments are likely to be the workhorse study design used to generate evidence about the comparative effectiveness of alternative treatments, because of their feasibility, timeliness, affordability and external validity compared with randomized trials. In this review, we outline potential sources of discordance in results between quasi-experiments and experiments, review study design choices that can improve the internal validity of quasi-experiments, and outline innovative data linkage strategies that may be particularly useful in quasi-experimental comparative effectiveness research. There is an urgent need to resolve the debate about the evidentiary value of quasi-experiments since equal consideration of rigorous quasi-experiments will broaden the base of evidence that can be brought to bear in clinical decision-making and governmental policy-making.},

  abstract = {Study objective: We sought to determine the proportion of emergency department patients who frequently use the ED and to compare their frequency of use of other health care services at non-ED sites. Methods: A computerized patient database covering all ambulatory visits and hospital admissions at all care facilities in the county of Stockholm, Sweden, was used. Frequent ED patients were defined as those making 4 or more visits in a 12-month period. Results: Frequent users comprised 4\% of total ED patients, accounting for 18\% of the ED visits. The ED was the only source of ambulatory care for 13\% of frequent versus 27\% of rare ED users (1 ED visit). Primary care visits were made by 72\% of frequent ED users versus 57\% by rare ED visitors. The corresponding figures for hospital admission were 80\% and 36\%, respectively. Frequent ED visitors were also more likely to use other care facilities repeatedly: their odds ratio (adjusted for age and sex) was 3.43 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 3.10 to 3.78) for 5 or more primary care visits and 29.98 (95\% CI 26.33 to 34.15) for 5 or more hospital admissions. In addition, heavy users had an elevated mortality (standardized mortality ratio 1.55; 95\% CI 1.26 to 1.90). Conclusion: High ED use patients are also high users of other health care services, presumably because they are sicker than average. A further indication of serious ill health is their higher than expected mortality. This knowledge might be helpful for care providers in their endeavors to find appropriate ways of meeting the needs of this vulnerable patient category.
